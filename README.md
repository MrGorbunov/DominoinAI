# Dominion AI

An implementation of a dominion AI, but like not yet.
In the end, this will be maybe a functional AI for the
card game of [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion), a game heavily inspired by
this [online predecssor](https://dominion.games/index.html).



## RoadMap

#### Goal #1 - Create Dominion Simulation

- [ ] Simple Game Evironment
  - [ ] Estate, Duchy, Copper, Silver, Province
  - [ ] User Input
  - [ ] Program Input (for simulation)
  - [ ] Add Some Action Card (market, festival, village, moat)

- [ ] Expandable Game Evironment
  - [ ] General way to add cards
  - [ ] Tests ?
  - [ ] Build System ?


#### Goal #2 - Make AI

- [ ] Single-Player AI (AI that doesn't think about others)
  - [ ] Some representations of game state
  - [ ] Some kind of evolution
  - [ ] We'll figure it out


#### Goal #3 - Make Good AI

- [ ] Some kind of PoG AI ?
  - [ ] Converges to Nash Equilibrium?
  - [ ] Regret minimization?
  - [ ] Monte Carlo Tree Search
  - [ ] Minimal knowledge about the game


#### Future Future Work

- [ ] Write a paper
- [ ] Get a PhD
- [ ] Solve Chess
- [ ] Revolutionize AI
- [ ] Win a Fields Medal
